Artificial Intelligence - Introductory Concepts
An introductory project exploring basic Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts through interactive Python notebooks.

🚀 Main Features
Text Processing & Analysis: Applies fundamental AI/NLP techniques to analyze and manipulate textual data.

Interactive Environment: Developed using Jupyter Notebook, allowing for step-by-step code execution, immediate feedback, and integrated documentation.

Local Dataset Integration: Utilizes a classic piece of Romanian literature ("Pupăza din tei") as the primary input data for practical text processing exercises.

📁 Project Structure
tema1.ipynb: The core Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, algorithms, and analytical steps.

Pupăza_din_tei.txt: The raw text file serving as the dataset for the AI/NLP tasks.

🛠️ Required Dependencies
To execute the code and reproduce the results, you will need:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (alternatively, the notebook can be imported and run in Google Colab).

Standard Python libraries for text processing (e.g., built-in string manipulation, re for regex, or basic NLP libraries depending on the notebook's specific implementation).
