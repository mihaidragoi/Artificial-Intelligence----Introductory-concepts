An introductory project focused on core data preprocessing techniques and text analysis using Python, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. 🚀

✨ Key Features:

📊 Data Standardization: Manual implementation of column-wise standardization (mean and standard deviation) with validation against Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler.

📏 Min-Max Normalization: Custom function to scale numerical data into the [0, 1] range, verified using MinMaxScaler.

🩹 Missing Data Imputation: Handling missing values (NaN) by replacing them with column means, compared with Scikit-Learn's SimpleImputer.

📝 Advanced Text Analysis: A comprehensive text processor that calculates detailed statistics:

Character, word, and line counting.

Punctuation removal and case normalization.

Analysis of unique vs. duplicate words.

Vowel/consonant distribution and word density.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Language: Python 3

Libraries: NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
